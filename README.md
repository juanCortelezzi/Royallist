# Royallist

A glorified "ls" command.

Don't be surprised, it's just ls with icons written in Go

## How to use?

Call royallist and watch you current directory files shine in the terminal. If you want to use
another directory, pass it as a first argument just like "ls" and on you go.
```bash
royallist

or

royallist ~/Documents
```

For ease of use, I recommend aliasing Royallist to a simpler command:

Just add the following to your shell RC file

```bash
alias l="royallist"
```
